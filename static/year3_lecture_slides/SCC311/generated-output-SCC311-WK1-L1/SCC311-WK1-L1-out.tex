(Q)
Describe: Examples of Distributed Systems
\clearpage
\section{Examples of Distributed Systems}
\\
■ Financial trading\\
➔ Support execution of trading transactions\\
➔ Dissemination and processing of events\\
■ Web search\\
➔ The web consists of over 6 billion web pages across 8.2 \\
million servers with an average lifetime of about 2 months.\\
➔ Modern web engines serve over 3.5 billion searches per day\\
 \textgreater  Major distributed systems challenges\\
■ Massively multiplayer online games\\
➔ Online games (e.g. Fortnite, Among Us) support large \\
numbers of users viewing and changing a common world\\
➔ Need for very low latency coordination to support gameplay\\

(Q)
Describe: Why Distributed Systems?
\clearpage
\section{Why Distributed Systems?}
\\
■ Because the world is distributed\\
➔ You want to book a hotel in Sydney, but you are in Lancaster\\
➔ You want to be able to retrieve money from any ATM in the world, \\
but your bank is in London\\
➔ An airplane has 1 cockpit, 2 wings, 4 engines, 10k sensors, etc.\\
0 Similarly railway networks, and other distributed transport systems\\
■ Because problems rarely hit two different places at the same \\
time\\
➔ As a company having only one database server is a bad idea\\
➔ Having two in the same room is better, but still risky\\
■ Because joining forces increases performance, availability, etc.\\
➔ High Performance Computing, replicated web servers, etc.\\

\section{A Short History of DSs}
\\
■ Distributed Computer Systems are largely concerned with:\\
➔ Data processing/ management/ presentation (“computing” side)\\
➔ Communication/ coordination (“distributed side”)\\
■ Those concerns existed well before computers were invented\\
➔ Ancient civilisations needed efficient communication:\\
0 cf. the Postal Service of the Persian Empire (6th century BC), \\
the Roman roads (many still visible today), etc.\\
0 assuming a good infrastructure (roads, horses, staging posts)\\
0 max message speed: \~ 200 miles/day in the Persian system\\
➔ Delays impose distributed organisations\\
0 Persian and Roman empires extended over 1000s of miles\\
➔ Trust / secrecy / reliability issues\\
0 Am I sure Governor X is doing what he says he is?\\
■ This all has not really changed! \\
Things have only sped up.\\

Describe: A Short History of DSs
\clearpage
\section{A Short History of DSs}
\\
■ Computers are far more recent\\
➔ The first “modern” computers appeared just after WWII\\
➔ They were slow, bulky, and incredibly expensive\\
0 The ENIAC (1945), used by the US army: 30 tons, 170 m2 footprint,\\
180 kilowatts, 18,000 vacuum tubes, and 5,000 additions/second (5KHz),\\
0 Price: \$500,000 (in US\$ of the time, would be  \textgreater  \$5,000,000 today)\\
■ And distributed computing is even more recent\\
➔ For a long time, only very few computers were around anyway\\
➔ No practical technology to connect them\\
➔ This all changed in the 80’s:\\
0 The rise of the micro-computers (PC, Mac, etc.)\\
0 The launch of the “Internet” (1982, TCP/IP), after 10 years of development\\
1940s 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s 00s 10s 20s\\

\\
■ A bank asks you to program their new ATM software\\
➔ Central bank computer (server) stores account information\\
➔ Remote ATMs authenticate customers and deliver money\\
■ A first version of the program\\
➔ ATM: (ignoring authentication and security issues)\\
1. Ask customer how much money s/he wants\\
2. Send message with  \textless customer ID, withdraw, amount \textgreater  to bank server\\
3. Wait for bank server answer:  \textless OK \textgreater  or  \textless refused \textgreater \\
4. If  \textless OK \textgreater  give money to customer, else display error message\\
➔ Central Server:\\
1. Wait for messages from ATM:  \textless customer ID, withdraw, amount \textgreater \\
2. If enough money withdraw money, send  \textless OK \textgreater , else send  \textless refused \textgreater \\

■ But ...\\
